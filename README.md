# Programmle
Wordle but for programmers...

Basics:
If you're not an English major like me but you still want to play Wordle, look no further! Here is my project Programmle! The objective of this game is to guess what is in each element of a mystery list. With each guess you will get more and more information to guide you towards guessing the mystery list! Even better, you can decide how difficult you want your game to be. You can choose how long you want the mystery list to be (just be careful though, if you make a giant list it will take you a while to complete!).

More stuff:
The mystery list can have integers, booleans, None, strings, and MORE lists!!! Luckily there are restrictions so the game doesn't immediately become impossible. Integers will have values 0-100, strings will only have two lowercase letters, and lists will be length 1-5 with only integers 0-9 in each index. 

Guessing the list:
After every guess, you will see a check list which shows how your list chan be changed into the mystery list. One of four things can happen in each element of your guess:
1) You got the correct thing in the correct spot in your list!
2) You got the correct type in the correct spot of your list, but the value isn't correct.
3) You got an incorrect type in a specific spot of your list, BUT you can find your guessed type somewhere else in the mystery list.
4) Everything about the entry is wrong :( the type you specified doesn't appear anywhere else in the list.

Once you guessed the mystery list:
YAY! You're done! You will be able to see how many tries it took you. You can play again and maybe give yourself an even bigger challenge with a larger mystery list!

The future for this project:
Unfortunately there is no UI to this project so you can only play this game in your console. Additionally, you can't compete with your friends (technically you can but you need to change the code so that the mystery list gets set to whatever is to your liking)! I will try to work on implementing these things some day in the future... But please enjoy what I have for you right now!

Thank you for reading this page and I hope you have fun! :D
